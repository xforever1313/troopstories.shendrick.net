In the middle of the [Great Sacandaga Lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Sacandaga_Lake), there is an island that is named [Scout Island](http://www.trcscouting.org/News/scoutislandinformation).  No, really, that's its name.  Even check [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Scout+Island/@43.0904926,-74.2150431,1518m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m13!1m7!3m6!1s0x89de589f61d62151:0xb1996dd83d247f09!2sScout+Island!3b1!8m2!3d43.0909064!4d-74.2137437!3m4!1s0x89de589f61d62151:0xb1996dd83d247f09!8m2!3d43.0909064!4d-74.2137437) if you don't believe me.

Almost every year, Troop 53 would paddle canoes to the northeastern side of the island and camp on the beach there.  We would canoe, swim, fish, or walk around the island.

Take a peek at the Google Maps linked above.  You will notice on the northeastern side of the island, there is a peninsula that extends east, and then north, and there's a small island at the tip of this peninsula.  Although tough to tell in the Google Maps picture, during the summer, the water was low enough where we could walk out to the island at the tip of the peninsula.  This, is where stick wars was played.  And that's where our story begins.

In 2006, I believe, a fresh wave of scouts crossed over from Pack 253.  I was patrol leader at the time of the Flaming Arrows Patrol.  A young scout, we'll call him Wayne, was added to my patrol.  Wayne, along with all the new scouts, would walk out to the tip of the peninsula, and play what they called "stick wars".  I never participated in stick wars, but from what I understood, the scouts would pick up sticks they found at the tip of the peninsula, and... well... hopefully they didn't wack each other with them.

This game was the latest obsession with all of the new scouts.  When they weren't eating or swimming they were on the tip of the peninsula, playing stick wars... much to the annoyance of the older scouts.  Don't get me wrong, us older scouts were fine with the younger scouts leaving us alone.  What was annoying was when we had to do chores and they didn't come to help.
