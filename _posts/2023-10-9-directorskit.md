Every year, our troop would have a court of honor.  It was when we all gathered at the local fire house and had a delicious dinner, and celebrate everyone's accomplishments throughout the year.  It was tradition that each year, there would be a skit.

The year 2004 (or so) was no exception, and I got drafted into doing a skit with my friend Jim and a few other scouts.  This skit was a version on the [Making a Film](https://scoutermom.com/25556/making-a-film-skit/) skit, also known as "The Director".  The idea is a scene plays out normally, but at the end of the take, the director doesn't like it.  So, they add some suggestions such as make it a musical, or make it fast, or slow it down.  At the end, the director likes the last take.  I won't spoil the final punch line from there :).

I brought my video camera with me, and Matt M, playing the camera man, recorded it.  Below, you'll see a video of us being silly and having fun.  I play the doctor, and Jim plays the guy who calls for help.

I hope you enjoyed it, we had fun putting it on!
