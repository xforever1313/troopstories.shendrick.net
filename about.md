I was involved in the Boy Scouts for many years.  I started as a Tiger Cub in first grade in 1997.  I crossed over to Boy Scout sometime in 2002, and got my Eagle Scout award in 2009.  I then stayed on as an Assistant Scoutmaster for two more years before moving away for college.

My time in Scouting had many memories, funny stories, crazy people, and I met good friends.  The purpose of this site it to retell those stories… mainly for myself so I don’t forget any of it  But perhaps you can get some laughs from it too!

Throughout this site, everyone’s name is not their name in real life to protect their privacy.  However, each fake name represents the same person.  So “Bob” in one story is the same “Bob” in another story.

Also, since I should say it, this site is not officially associated with the Boy Scouts of America.  I am but some random guy who is retelling his stories from his time in scouts.  Also, because my job requires it, the opinions that appear on this site are entirely my own, and do not necessarily represent the opinions of any employer I work for.

Have fun reading our memories!
