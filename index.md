## Welcome

This site contains stories from alumni of Troop 53 in Castleton-On-Hudson NY!

This is *NOT* the official site of BSA Troop 53.  If you are looking for the official website, sadly, the former webmaster of [bsatroop53.com](http://bsatroop53.com) has passed away, and no one from the troop has maintained the site.  However, links to an archived version of the site can be found there.
