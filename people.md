## Overview

This is a quick overview about the people that were in my troop.  For privacy reasons, all of their names are different than what they are in real life.  However, the names are consistent across all stories.  So "Bob" in one story is the same "Bob" as in all other stories.

The way this page is organized is by grade-school graduating class, and my extension, the year we joined scouts.  "Generation 0" means that the person was the same age as me (i.e. we were in the same school year).  "Generation 1" means that the person is a year younger than me (i.e. they were in the school year after me).  "Generation 2" mean that the person is two years younger than me, etc.  "Generation -1" means that the person is a year older than me, while "Generation -2" means that the person is 2 years older than me, etc.

All adult leaders, meanwhile, have "Mr." or "Mrs." in front of their names.

## Generation 0

### Seth (me)

The only person on this site with a real name is myself (I mean, the domain is a subdomain of  [shendrick.net](https://shendrick.net), its obvious who the author is), so there's no reason to hide my name :P.

In my time in scouts, I started as the troop librarian.  This was an easy job, just make sure people returned their books on time.  I then became the assistant patrol leader (APL) for the Flaming Arrows patrol with my friend Bert as the leader.  I then became the patrol leader for several years afterwards, and always somehow won re-election despite being a meh leader.  My last election cycle, I became the assistant senior patrol leader (ASPL), before getting my Eagle and turning 18.

I then hung around for 2 years while I attended community college at [HVCC](https://hvcc.edu).  When I graduated from HVCC, I moved away to attend [RIT](https://rit.edu), and left the troop.

### Bert

Bert was my best friend in scouts.  We were always tent-mates during summer camps.  We were in the same patrol: The Flaming Arrows.  Bert became Eagle several years before I did.

### Rodger

Rodger was another one of my best friends in scouts.  Despite being a jerk, he was well loved by all of the younger scouts.  His dad (and eventually him when he got his license) drove to camping trips in a massive van.  The van had a TV in it, so we could play video games on the way to camping trips.

Rodger and I were in the same Den together, in fact his dad was our Den leader.

### Jake

Jake was another one of my best friends, and actually the first friend I had when I moved to Castleton.  He joined Cub Scouts a few years after I did.

He was a well-loved member of the troop.  He was senior patrol leader (SPL) for one year, and he did a good job with it.  Since we were neighbors, him, myself, and Iggy would carpool to meetings together.

### Iggy

Iggy moved to Castleton when I was in 6th grade and was my next door neighbor.  We had a... rocky relationship at the start; but we got over it and became friends.

He became Eagle a few years before I did.  He was SPL for one year, and he was also the Quartermaster for a bit as well.  When he turned 18, he became an assistant scoutmaster until he went off to college.

### Kevin

Kevin was a three-season athlete, but he still made time to go to troop meetings.  To the younger scouts, he was intimidating, so they listened to him.  In my opinion, he was one of the most effective SPLs we had in our troop while I was there.

He also stuck around after turning 18 as an assistant scoutmaster.
